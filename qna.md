### Does typehint helps python code runtime?

**Answer:** Type hints in Python do not directly affect the runtime behavior of your code. They are primarily used for static analysis and documentation purposes. 
Here's what type hints do:
- **Static Analysis:** Type hints provide information to static analysis tools (like linters, type checkers, IDEs) to help catch errors and improve code quality during development. They can help identify potential type-related bugs before runtime.
- **Documentation:** Type hints serve as a form of documentation, making it clearer for developers to understand the expected types of arguments and return values for functions and methods. 
- **Readability:** They can improve code readability by explicitly stating the expected types, making it easier for other developers to understand the code.

However, Python itself is dynamically typed, meaning that types are determined at runtime. Thus, type hints are not enforced by the Python interpreter during runtime. Python will not raise an error if the actual types at runtime do not match the type hints specified in the code. Instead, type hints are primarily used by external tools and libraries for static analysis.
