# Data Structures: 

## Linear Data Structures: Contiguous memory locations used to store elements of the same data type.

- **Linked Lists:** Each element (node) contains a reference to the next element in the sequence.
- **Stacks:** Follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle; elements are inserted and removed from the same end.
- **Queues:** Follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle; elements are inserted at the rear and removed from the front.
- **Vectors:** Similar to arrays but can dynamically resize to accommodate more elements. Same as list in python

## Nonlinear (Hierarchical) Data Structures:
- **Trees:** Consists of nodes connected by edges in a hierarchical structure. Various types include:
- **Binary Trees:** Each node has at most two children.
- **Binary Search Trees (BSTs):** Binary trees where the left child is smaller and the right child is greater than the parent node.
- **AVL Trees:** Self-balancing binary search trees to maintain a balanced structure.
- **Red-Black Trees:** Another type of self-balancing binary search tree.
- **Graphs:** Consists of a set of vertices (nodes) connected by edges. Various types include:
- **Directed Graphs (Digraphs):** Edges have a direction.
- **Undirected Graphs:** Edges have no direction.
- **Weighted Graphs:** Edges have weights assigned to them.
- **Sparse Graphs:** Few connections between vertices.
- **Dense Graphs:** Many connections between vertices.
- **Hash Tables:** Maps keys to values using a hash function, allowing for efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion.
- **Heaps:** A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property; commonly used for priority queues.
- **Tries (Prefix Trees):** A tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings; each node represents a common prefix.
