# Design a Hashmap in your preferred language

A hashmap, also known as a hash table or dictionary in some programming languages,
is a data structure that maps keys to values. It provides efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.
The basic idea behind a hashmap is to use a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots,
from which the desired value can be found.

### Here's how a hashmap typically works:

- **Hash Function:** A hash function takes a key as input and produces a hash code, which is typically an integer. The purpose of the hash function is to convert the key into a numeric value that can be used as an index in the underlying array.
 

- **Index Calculation:** The hash code generated by the hash function is then used to calculate an index in the array. This index determines the location where the key-value pair will be stored.


- **Collision Handling:** Since different keys may hash to the same index (a collision), a hashmap must have a mechanism to handle collisions. There are several strategies for collision resolution, such as chaining (using linked lists or other data structures to store multiple entries in the same bucket) or open addressing (finding alternative locations in the array).


- **Storage of Key-Value Pairs:** The key-value pairs are stored in the array based on the calculated index. Each slot in the array typically contains either a single key-value pair or a reference to a data structure (like a linked list) that holds multiple key-value pairs.


- **Retrieval and Modification:** To retrieve a value associated with a key, the hashmap calculates the index using the hash function, goes to the corresponding slot in the array, and retrieves the value stored there. Similarly, to add or modify a key-value pair, the hashmap calculates the index, goes to the corresponding slot, and updates the value.

HashMaps are widely used in computer science and software engineering due to their efficiency in providing constant-time average-case performance for basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and lookup, assuming a good hash function and proper handling of collisions. They are commonly used in various programming tasks, including database indexing, caching, and implementing associative arrays or dictionaries in programming languages.
